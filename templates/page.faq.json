Our formula has 4x the electrolytes of leading sports drinks but contains no added sugar or artificial ingredients. This scientifically balanced formula can be used to help combat dehydration caused by everyday activities including exercise, drinking alcohol, travel, or illness.<\/p>"

            "title": "What is an Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS)?",
            "answer": "<p>Oral Rehydration Solution is a formula used to prevent and treat dehydration. An exact ratio of glucose-to-sodium triggers the sodium glucose transporter mechanism in the body that helps to rapidly absorb water and electrolytes into the bloodstream. The formula was originally pioneered by the World Health Organization to treat severe dehydration in people suffering from Cholera and has saved over 50 million lives. ORS is considered to be significantly safer and just as effective as fluid replacement through an IV drip. This innovation in hydration science has over 50 years of research and is considered to be one of the greatest medical advances of the last century.<\/p>"

            "answer": "<p>Don’t get us wrong – we love water. But water on its own is often not enough to properly rehydrate our bodies. Sweat loss, alcohol consumption, travel, illness and a variety of other factors can lead to electrolyte imbalances. These imbalances prevent our bodies from effectively absorbing water into our bloodstreams, leading to dehydration.<\/p>"

If you’re doing strenuous exercise, you can drink Cure either before, during, or immediately after your workout. If you’re hoping to ward off a hangover, it’s best to drink Cure before you go to bed. Starting your day with Cure is also a great way to naturally energize!<\/p>"

We use a proprietary technology to evaporate the water from coconuts while maintaining all of the valuable nutrients and minerals you find in coconut water. This way you get all of the benefits from coconut water without the energy required to ship and refrigerate liquids. Our convenient stick pack also requires 95% less packaging than a plastic bottle.<\/p>"

When mixed with a liquid such as water and refrigerated, Cure will stay fresh for up to 1 week. Given the purity of ingredients and lack of additives, clumping sometimes occurs when the powder is exposed to heat or humidity. This does not reduce the effectiveness or flavor of the product - it’s natural and harmless. Simply give the stick pack a quick shake and the powder will dissolve properly once mixed with water.<\/p>"

            "title": "Does Cure contain artificial sweeteners?",
            "answer": "<p>No. Cure uses a blend of natural sugar alternatives including Organic Stevia Extract and Monk Fruit that contains no calories. Stevia leaf extract is born from the sweet leaves of the stevia plant and Monk Fruit is a vine-ripened fruit native to Asia that helps round out the flavor so that there is no bitter aftertaste.<\/p><p>Despite the common misconception, stevia is not an artificial sweetener! In order to extract the natural sweetness of the stevia plant, its leaves are harvested, dried, and then steeped in hot water. The resulting extract mixture is then filtered, purified, and finally dried to create a crystalized extract which we use in our formula. Since stevia is much sweeter than sugar (about 200 times sweeter, in fact), we only need to use a very small amount in each serving of Cure.<\/p>"
