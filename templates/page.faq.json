An exact ratio of glucose-to-sodium triggers the sodium glucose transporter mechanism in the body that helps to rapidly absorb water and electrolytes into the bloodstream. The formula was originally pioneered by the World Health Organization to treat severe dehydration in people suffering from Cholera and has saved over 50 million lives. ORS is considered to be significantly safer and just as effective as fluid replacement through an IV drip. This innovation in hydration science has over 50 years of research and is considered to be one of the greatest medical advances of the last century.<\/p>"}},"90b7e4b4-45d7-4112-97d6-ebcec72a26db":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Why isn't water enough on it's own?","answer":"<p>Don’t get us wrong – we love water. But water on its own is often not enough to properly rehydrate our bodies. Sweat loss, alcohol consumption, travel, illness and a variety of other factors can lead to electrolyte imbalances. These imbalances prevent our bodies from effectively absorbing water into our bloodstreams, leading to dehydration.<\/p><p>When should I drink Cure?<\/p>"}},"0ed86fff-9bca-488d-b6ce-d92979a828d2":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"When should I drink Cure?","answer":"<p>You should drink Cure whenever you expect to sweat or after you’re feeling the symptoms of dehydration (such as fatigue, headaches, or loss of focus). If you’re doing strenuous exercise, you can drink Cure either before, during, or immediately after your workout. If you’re hoping to ward off a hangover, it’s best to drink Cure before you go to bed. Starting your day with Cure is also a great way to naturally energize!<\/p>"}},"b112bfe9-fafd-4d83-8902-d7a7ade5f80a":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Why does Cure come in powder form and not liquid?","answer":"<p>Cure is currently sold in powdered form to reduce our carbon footprint and provide customers with a portable hydration option. We use a proprietary technology to evaporate the water from coconuts while maintaining all of the valuable nutrients and minerals you find in coconut water. This way you get all of the benefits from coconut water without the energy required to ship and refrigerate liquids. Our convenient stick pack also requires 95% less packaging than a plastic bottle.<\/p>"}},"06af53ee-40b5-4649-9208-b63cc2b78bab":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Where is Cure manufactured?","answer":"<p>Our hydration mix is manufactured and packaged right here in the US.<\/p>"}},"d0825495-5e3d-4342-81f7-5c5e2d484f01":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Is Cure’s formula organic? ","answer":"<p>Cure is a certified organic product made with organic ingredients like 100% organic coconut water.<\/p>"}},"0ef2ec7f-6813-41ba-ac70-080c29e08660":{"type":"category","settings":{"title":"Subscription Management"}},"fca33577-7895-49a9-bf74-c52adf1544f0":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Can I make changes to or cancel my subscription?","answer":"<p>Absolutely!
